Linux Bootloader Tools for Compaq Evo Thin Client T30
Written by Dwayne C. Litzenberger

This package contains tools for creating and loading network-bootable Linux
images that can be loaded on a Compaq Evo T30 using 100% free software and
without any modification to the device's internal flash memory.  Previous
approaches were more cumbersome and required users to download and modify the
manufacturer's proprietary firmware image.


EXAMPLE: BUILDING AND LOADING A "FIRMWARE" IMAGE (AKA "bootp.bin")

Note that although we are using the "firmware update" process, this software
does not modify the Evo T30's flash memory.  Of course, there is always a
chance that your experience may differ from that of the author.  If this
software somehow damages your device, the author cannot be held responsible.
(Though bug reports would be appreciated!)

1. Build boot/loader.bin
    make -C boot

2. Build your Linux bzImage file.

3. Create a file ("cmdline.txt") containing your Linux kernel command-line.
You may want to consider the following options to enaable a serial console:

    earlyprintk=serial,ttyS0,115200
    console=ttyS0,115200
    console=tty0
    video=gx1fb:1024x768-16@60

4. Build your bootp.bin file:

    ./mknbi-linux-netxfer -C cmdline.txt -o bootp.bin /path/to/bzImage

5. At this point, you can load the file using NetXfer.  This package includes
the script "netxfer-server" for your convenience as a simpler alternative to
configuring and running full-blown DHCP and TFTP servers.  If your server's
address is 10.0.0.10 and your Evo's address is 10.0.0.22, then you can run the
following command on your server (as root):

    ./netxfer-server -i eth0 -s 10.0.0.10 -c 10.0.0.22 bootp.bin

6. Connect a keyboard to your Evo T30 and power it on.  The power light will
turn amber, then flicker off and turn amber again as the keyboard is
initialized.  At that point, press 'P' on the keyboard.  Your Evo should
display something like this:

    NETXFER 09.73 10067 10068 10069
    MAC address 00:80:64:xx:xx:xx
    Contacting Server       [4001](02)

After a few moments, you should see the bootloader being downloaded and
started.


KNOWN ISSUES

- The PCI IRQ ("$PIR") table is probably wrong, especially for the PCMCIA
  slot.  This could be fixed: We just need to know how the INTA#-INTD# pins
  are wired on the board.

- The fake (E820) memory map is hard-coded for a device with 32 MiB of RAM.
  It's wrong for devices with more memory, and it's probably overly
  conservative.  (We don't have a BIOS, so we probably don't need to reserve
  the BIOS addresses.)

- The bootloader assumes the kernel supports a recent version of the Linux
  32-bit boot protocol (see Documentation/x86/boot.txt).  Older kernels might
  not boot.  (Version 2.6.28 is known to work.)

- We don't supply any proprietary firmware, so the Geode Virtual System
  Architecture (VSA) code is missing.  This means that we have to run without
  PC BIOS, Video BIOS, and XpressAudio firmware.  The snd_cs5530 ALSA driver
  does not work, but there is apparently a native driver for FreeBSD that
  could be ported to Linux.  See:

- The PCI configuration in general might be wrong, since I haven't yet looked
  at the PCI specifications.

- The parallel port is untested.  (The serial port works, though.)
